# svm-image-classification
This project implements an SVM model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It classifies 32x32 color images into 10 categories such as airplanes, cars, and animals. The model is trained on a subset of CIFAR-10 for faster processing and evaluates performance using classification reports and confusion matrices.
